However until a few years ago I never really studied finance. Since I decided to change that, I have learnt finance from reading good and bad books, online courses, newspapers, blog posts and online forums and by executing trades. This post sums up and prioritizes the roadmap I recommend taking to learn about finance. Having a deep understanding of macroeconomics is not necessary to learn about finance, even less if you are only looking to manage your own money.</p><div class=tag_container><span>Tags:</span>

After studying and working with distributed systems my interests drifted into data science, artificial intelligence, machine learning and now statistics. After a while I found I really liked applying what I have learnt into finance. That is how I learnt about probabilistic programming and PyMC while reading Thomas Wiecki posts at Quantopian blog.</p><div class=tag_container></div></div></li><li class="item_wrapper main"><div class=date>2018.09.05</div><div class=content><p class=title><a href=https://catalinasy.github.io/not_a_monad_tutorial/posts/theres-more-to-life-than-htt/>There&#39;s more to life than HTTP, VerneMQ a high-performance and distributed MQTT broker</a></p><p class=summary>At LambdaClass and our blog This is not a Monad tutorial we are a big fans of exploring new topics, different operating systems, platforms, languages and libraries/frameworks. We have been talking in our company about exploring new subjects like protocols.
There is a whole generation of developers that has only worked with HTTP, ReST and JSON. While a partial improvement over previous technologies, it has created a protocol monoculture. There are situations where other protocols are better suited but many of the young bloods don’t even know they exist.</p><div class=tag_container></div></div></li><li class="item_wrapper main"><div class=date>2018.08.14</div><div class=content><p class=title><a href=https://catalinasy.github.io/not_a_monad_tutorial/posts/how-to-pretend/>How to pretend you have social skills</a></p><p class=summary>A software company from another dimension

I did so because I wanted to have more freedom in choosing the type of projects and team I work with.
That is why today it is a very special day for me. We take a break from regular interviews and celebrate the release of our first open source application: Holiday Ping.</p><div class=tag_container></div></div></li><li class="item_wrapper main"><div class=date>2017.05.09</div><div class=content><p class=title><a href=https://catalinasy.github.io/not_a_monad_tutorial/posts/lasp-a-little-further-down-the-erlang-rabbithole/>Lasp, a little further down the Erlang rabbithole</a></p><p class=summary>A few years ago I found Lasp: “a suite of libraries aimed at providing a comprehensive programming system for planetary scale Elixir and Erlang applications”. At this point it should come as no surprise for you to learn that here at Not a Monad Tutorial we are are interested in distributed systems and Erlang.

Craig works for citusdata, a company that helps customers scale databases beyond a single node. Over the last few years, after building systems that used Redis, Cassandra, Riak, Elasticsearch and even Mongo, I rediscovered my love for PostgreSQL. The documentation is excellent, its development pace is astonishing and it is a good old reliable beast. However its feature set can be quite overwhelming. To mention just a few of its special features: you got a big option of index types (B-tree, Hash, GiST, SP-GiST, GIN and BRIN), many data types, extensions, window functions, common table expressions, foreign data wrappers.</p><div class=tag_container></div></div></li><li class="item_wrapper main"><div class=date>2017.04.20</div><div class=content><p class=title><a href=https://catalinasy.github.io/not_a_monad_tutorial/posts/gaming-with-elixir-discovering-new-lands-in-the-beam-realm/>Gaming with Elixir, discoverting new lands in the BEAM realm</a></p><p class=summary>In this opportunity I interviewed somebody I don’t normally interview: a client, Chris Jimison, CTO of Merigo. One of my clients. After working for almost a year with Merigo, I appreciate and understand the differences between using a BEAM language to develop a typical REST JSON system and using it to develop a videogame backend.

In this opportunity I decided to interview Facundo Olano, a friend, a teammate, and a developer with a diverse experience. We talked about Python, Node.js, Clojure, Common Lisp and software development in general. Something worth mentioning is that this is not the first time Python and Clojure get mentioned together at Not a Monad Tutorial. Timothy Baldridge implemented Pixie, a Lisp language inspired by Clojure, in Python.</p><div class=tag_container><span>Tags:</span>

This time I interviewed Robert Virding, co-creator of Erlang and creator of Lisp Flavored Erlang (LFE). I am an Erlang developer and Lisp fan — if you are learning Clojure check out my post How to earn your Clojure white belt — so logically I am very excited about LFE.

From my completely subjective point of view Red and Rebol are quite strange creatures! But don’t get me wrong, that doesn’t mean something bad.
