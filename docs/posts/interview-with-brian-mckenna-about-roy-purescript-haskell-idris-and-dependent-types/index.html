functional programming:</p><ol><li>Types and type inference (with row polymorphism)</li><li>Algebraic data types and pattern matching</li><li>Monadic syntax</li></ol><p><strong>Why did you create it?</strong></p><p>I created Roy after doing years of JavaScript work. I learned Haskell and it made a huge amount of sense to me. Functional programming with types seemed like the ideal way for me to work on software and so I wanted to bring it to web programming.</p><p><strong>I am tempted to say that Roy has some big similarities with Purescript. What are the main differences between the two languages?</strong></p><p>Roy was first!
PureScript had almost the exact same goals as Roy but had a much better implementation. Quoting the PureScript wiki:</p><blockquote><p><em>Roy is probably the most similar language on the list, and was a large influence on the development of PureScript.</em></p></blockquote><p>I stopped working on Roy once PureScript got around equal in functionality. PureScript’s implementation means it’s a lot easier to work on and has much fewer bugs.
Originally the PureScript FFI started off being very different (i.e. it used inline JS instead of an externs file) but recently changed to being similar to the original design Roy had. That was probably the biggest difference the projects had.</p><p><strong>You implemented the lexer and the parser. Did you do so to learn/play or because you thought that the available tools were not good enough?</strong></p><p>I implemented a whitespace sensitive lexer which was passed into the Jison parser generator. It was the same approach which CoffeeScript took.</p><p>A custom lexer was necessary because the <a href=https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*vYf7TCGE19Gni5ssKXQaHA.png>Jison</a> lexer generator was not capable of stateful scanning of whitespace.
I prefer working with parser combinators such as Parsec and Trifecta. They’re easier to work with and allow you to write reusable abstractions.</p><p><strong>Why did you use a whitespace sensitive grammar a la Python/Haskell in Roy?</strong></p><p>Just to look like Haskell. I hate thinking about syntax — I copy things as much as I can. I’m also annoyed that we’re still writing programs using text. They’re trees, not lists of characters!</p><p><strong>Why is it useful to have monadic sugar in a language that has unrestricted side effects?</strong></p><p>Roy was not designed to allow side-effects, but you could do anything with the FFI and so it was possible.
Scala has (pretty limited) monadic sugar and also unrestricted side-effects. People use monadic sugar for things as straight-forward as Option:</p><blockquote><p>for {
name &lt;- maybeFirstName
user &lt;- lookup(name)
avatar &lt;- getAvatar(user)
} yield avatar`</p></blockquote><p>Which can be easier to type than:</p><blockquote><p>maybeFirstName.flatMap { name =&gt;
lookup(name).flatMap { user =&gt;
getAvatar(user)
}
}</p></blockquote><p>It doesn’t have anything to do with side-effects.</p><p><strong>From what we could read in the Damas-Hindley-Milner type inference algorithm source comments it is based on Robert Smallshire’s Python code. Do you have any recommendation for those who want to implement it?</strong></p><p>I recommend reading “Generalizing Hindley-Milner Type Inference Algorithms” which turns the algorithm into explicit separate constraint collection and constraint solving problems, which is a bit easier to work with than plain Algorithm W. It’s then possible to do tree annotation via the cofree comonad, <a href=http://brianmckenna.org/blog/type_annotation_cofree>which gives a pretty nice implementation</a>.</p><p><strong>What reading material do you recommend for implementing your first programming language?</strong></p><p>Source code of other languages are great resources. I think the PureScript and Idris compilers are somewhat easy to play around with.
Hackage has a lot of code to look at, such as reference implementations of Algorithm W:
<a href=https://hackage.haskell.org/packages/>https://hackage.haskell.org/packages/</a></p><p><strong>What would you recommend us to read to learn about different type systems?</strong></p><p><a href=https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/>Types and Programming Languages</a> by Benjamin Pierce is a brilliant resource for understanding both. It’s surprised me by being a very good introduction to types and having pretty good reference implementations in OCaml for each of the discussed type-systems. Very highly recommended.</p><p><strong>Have you tried <a href=http://elm-lang.org/>Elm</a>? What do you think of <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_reactive_programming>FRP</a>?</strong></p><p>I think Functional Reactive Programming could be generalised a bit to just general stream combinator libraries and we could make it as simple as libraries such as pipes, machines and scalaz-stream. I’d like to implement one of those libraries in PureScript and try to write combinators to fill in the gaps for developing user interfaces to see how close we get to current FRP libraries.</p><p><strong>You recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4i7KrG1Afbk">gave a talk about Idris</a>, a language with dependent types. Could you explain what are dependent types?</strong></p><p>In non-dependently typed languages we have a way of making values depend upon other values: functions! In dependent typed languages we have those functions, but also functions which can return types.
Haskell has two completely separate languages: the language of values and the language of types. Recent versions of GHC give a way of promoting certain values up to types, but if you want to write a function over those values, you’ll have to write a version at the value level and separately at the type level.
Dependent-types remove the separation. If you write a function, you can reuse it for terms at any level.</p><p><strong>What are the practical benefits of using a language with dependent types?</strong></p><p>Since you can use values in your types, you can specify a lot more.
For example, I can specify that list reversal is an involution, i.e. reversing twice is the same as not reversing at all:</p><p><code>reverseInvolution : (xs : List a) -&gt; reverse (reverse xs) = r</code></p><p>No need for tests — if I implement a value for that type, I have a proof for all possible values.
Or we can specify that a sort function will generate a list where each element is smaller than the next. The implementation of sort will only compile if we prove that to be true.
We can also do things like metaprogramming, since we know more about the values which are passed in, we can compute fancy types for things such as literals.</p><p><strong>From what we have read from your blog you have learnt Coq and Agda. What can code monkeys like us learn from programming languages like Coq and Agda?</strong></p><p>I know a tiny amount of Coq and Agda. They teach people what types are capable of and how they can be used to interactively prove programs correct. It’ll also show the potential of typed metaprogramming, for example allowing the type of printf to depend upon the input string or how it’s possible to write your own statically checked literal strings.</p><p><strong>Have you checked <a href=http://goto.ucsd.edu/~rjhala/liquid/haskell/blog/about/>LiquidHaskell</a>? What do you think about and refinement types?</strong></p><p>I think refinement types are interesting. It’s very exciting to just be able to add on annotations to existing programs and let proof searching do the rest but I’d prefer dependent types to be a research area for a couple of reasons:</p><ol><li>LiquidHaskell can do some dependent looking things but doesn’t have full pi-types so can’t do as much as real dependent types</li><li>We’re relying on an SMT solver to come up with a reasoning for why something is true, dependent types allow you to create and manipulate your own justifications — this might be solvable just via tooling, though</li></ol><p><strong>What other languages or technologies are you keeping an eye on that we should check?</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Morte</strong> by Gabriel Gonzalez is a brilliant way of talking about distributable programs. I want to work on Morte to create a database of super-optimised code, where package management is about functions, not libraries. Morte has a pretty good introduction <a href=https://hackage.haskell.org/package/morte-1.2.1/docs/Morte-Tutorial.html>here</a>.</li><li>Paul Chiusano’s <strong><a href=http://unisonweb.org/>Unison</a></strong> is an attempt at removing the “list of characters” problem from programming. It’s also trying to create a better UX for functional programming.</li></ol></p></main><div class=footer></div></body></html>
